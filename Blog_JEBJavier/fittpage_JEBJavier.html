                <p><strong>F.I.T.T.</strong> subject is a fun yet challenging subject. I was challenged on every exercise/ performance that we need to accomplish every week. I'm thankful for this subject because it helps me to change my lifestyle not instantly but by step by step process. I learned that even in this quarantine times, we should practice exercising in our home for us to stay fit and reduce the chance of developing different diseases.

                <p>I'm happy that this subject exists because it created a new bond with my cousins. We helped each others' to finish the task that was given to us. It also helped me to think positive, motivate myself that <strong>"I can do it!"</strong> ,trust the abilities that I have and practice it to make it better.</p>

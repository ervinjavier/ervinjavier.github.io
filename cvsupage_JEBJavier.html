                <p><strong>CvSU-101</strong> became one of my favorite subjects because our professor Mrs. Joy was very happy while teaching us in our synchronous classes. I also love this subject because with this subject, I learned the history of <strong>Cavite State University</strong>. I also learned the CvSU hymn when our professor told us to memorize it because we had an online performance task which is about singing the CvSU hymn while our eyes are covered with our hands.
                </p><br>
                <p>This subject taught me that history is important especially that I'm studying here in this University. I'm hoping for a great experience in this University since I'm still a 1st year college student here.</p>

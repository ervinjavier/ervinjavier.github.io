                <p>At first, I thought that learning new programming language is hard because I only know <strong>JAVA</strong> and I thinked that it is hard to switch from the existing programming language that I know to a new programming language. I was forced to learn <strong>Python</strong> because it is one of my subjects this semester but then I realized that coding using the python language was easier than I expected. It has simpler interface and syntax than java.  
                </p><br>
                <p>I was amazed on the different things that Python language can do. I watched lot of videos on youtube about python programming and most of the time, they use python for <strong>machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep-learning, algorithms, openCV</strong> and more. As of now, I don't really understand those terms but I have the ideas and I'm willing to learn and do it on my own.  </p>
